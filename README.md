ðŸ‘‹ hey, I'm Drew, a self-taught developer from the states.

## About
I develop tools and release reverse engineered work here for my own educational purposes.
Ever since I was a kid I have always had a knack for learning how things work.
Currently game engines have begun pique my interest a lot as I plan to go to university for
game development. All I want is something to show for my life, something-- magical, to prove that I have made it.

### Tools I use
* [MinHook v1.3.3](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook)
    * [Direct Download (Windows)](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook/releases/download/v1.3.3/MinHook_133_bin.zip)
* [Microsoft Detours v4.0.1](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours)
